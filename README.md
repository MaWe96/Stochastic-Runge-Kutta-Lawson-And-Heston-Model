Stochastic Runge-Kutta Lawson Schemes Applied to the Heston Model.

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation and results for my bachelor thesis, which investigates Stochastic Runge-Kutta Lawson (SRKL) schemes and their application to the Heston model.

Key topics:
- SRKL Schemes: Two SRKL discretization methods (Euler–Maruyama and Midpoint) are used to simulate asset dynamics under the Heston model.
- Option Pricing: European and Asian options are priced using Monte Carlo simulations and variance reduction techniques.
- Comparison: The performance of SRKL methods is compared to benchmark values based on accuracy, effectiveness, and computational complexity.
- Visualizations: Algorithms, simulations, heat maps, step size convergences.
- Appendix: MATLAB code and mathematical formulation of SKRL-applied Heston model.

Key results:
The study demonstrates that SRKL Euler–Maruyama schemes show promise in improving pricing for both simple and path-dependent options, offering advantages for option valuation in stochastic volatility models like the Heston model.
